# Autorecon

This project is a Python-based security scanner that automates the process of running various reconnaissance tools against a target domain. It collects the results, parses them, and generates a comprehensive security report in PDF format, along with a structured data dictionary in JSON format.

## How It Works

The `scanner.py` script orchestrates the entire process:

1.  **Scanner Execution:** It imports and runs various individual scanner modules (e.g., `dnsdumpster_scanner.py`, `nmap_scanner.py`, `httpx_scanner.py`) against the specified target domain. Each scanner saves its raw output to a file.
2.  **Data Parsing:** After each scan, the corresponding parser module (e.g., `dnsdumpster_parser.py`, `nmap_parser.py`) reads the raw output and extracts relevant information, transforming it into a structured JSON dictionary.
3.  **Data Aggregation:** All structured data from different scanners is aggregated into a single, comprehensive dictionary.
4.  **Data Dictionary Generation:** The aggregated data is then processed by `data_dictionary_generator.py` to create a categorized JSON data dictionary, providing a clear and organized overview of all collected information.
5.  **Report Generation:** Finally, `report_generator.py` takes the categorized data dictionary and generates a professional, human-readable PDF report, summarizing key findings and providing detailed analysis.

## Features

*   **Automated Reconnaissance:** Automates the execution of multiple open-source intelligence (OSINT) and network scanning tools.
*   **Structured Data Output:** Generates a well-organized JSON data dictionary for programmatic access and further analysis.
*   **Comprehensive PDF Reports:** Produces detailed and professional PDF reports summarizing scan results, including network information, subdomains, emails, web technologies, and live hosts.

### Integrated Scanners

*   **DNSDumpster:** Gathers DNS information (A, MX, NS, CNAME records).
*   **DNSEnum:** Enumerates DNS records and subdomains.
*   **HTTPX:** Probes for running HTTP/HTTPS services and extracts HTTP headers.
*   **Nmap:** Performs network scanning to identify open ports and services.
*   **Sublist3r:** Enumerates subdomains using various search engines.
*   **TheHarvester:** Gathers emails, subdomains, hosts, and other OSINT data.
*   **WhatWeb:** Identifies web technologies, content management systems (CMS), and other web-related information.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   The external tools used by the scanners (e.g., `curl` for DNSDumpster, `nmap`, `httpx`, `sublist3r`, `theharvester`, `whatweb`, `dnsenum`) must be installed on your system and accessible via your system's PATH.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Fawwazs17/python-security-scanner 
    cd python-security-scanner
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the scanner, simply execute the `scanner.py` script:

```bash
python scanner.py
```

Upon execution, the program will interactively prompt you to enter the author's name and the target domain to scan.

### Example

```bash
python scanner.py
```
(Then the user would be prompted for input)

All raw scanner outputs will be logged to a file in the `logs/` directory, and the generated data dictionary (JSON) and reconnaissance report (PDF) will be saved in the `reports/` directory.

At the beginning of the script execution, you will be prompted to enter your name, which will be included as the author in the PDF report.
